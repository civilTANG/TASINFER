If indices_or_sections is a 1-D array of sorted integers, the entries indicate where along axis the array is split.  For example, [2, 3] would, for axis=0, result in   ary[:2] ary[2:3] ary[3:]   If an index exceeds the dimension of the array along axis, an empty sub-array is returned correspondingly. "
