If the 3 is a 32-bit integer, the NumPy rules indicate it can&#8217;t convert losslessly into a 32-bit float, so a 64-bit float should be the result type. By examining the value of the constant, &#8216;3&#8217;, we see that it fits in an 8-bit integer, which can be cast losslessly into the 32-bit float. '"
