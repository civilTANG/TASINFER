The default is \u2018reduced\u2019, and to maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of numpy both it and the old default \u2018full\u2019 can be omitted. Note that array h returned in \u2018raw\u2019 mode is transposed for calling Fortran. The \u2018economic\u2019 mode is deprecated.  The modes \u2018full\u2019 and \u2018economic\u2019 may be passed using only the first letter for backwards compatibility, but all others must be spelled out. See the Notes for more explanation. "
