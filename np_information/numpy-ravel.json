Note that the \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019 options take no account of the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to the order of axis indexing.  \u2018A\u2019 means to read the elements in Fortran-like index order if a is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise.  \u2018K\u2019 means to read the elements in the order they occur in memory, except for reversing the data when strides are negative.  By default, \u2018C\u2019 index order is used. "
