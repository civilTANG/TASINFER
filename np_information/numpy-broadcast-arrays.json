Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcasted array may refer to a single memory location. If you need to write to the arrays, make copies first. While you can set the writable flag True, writing to a single output value may end up changing more than one location in the output array.  Deprecated since version 1.17: The output is currently marked so that if written to, a deprecation warning will be emitted. A future version will set the writable flag False so writing to it will raise an error.  "
